Image : screenshot of the UI website
Previous Iteration : previous iteration's SVG code
your task is to analyze all the given data and convert it  into a detailed, minimalist, Balsamiq-style SVG wireframe. Adhere to the following specifications:

Detailed Structure:

Analyze the hierarchy of the UI and replicate the original website layout as closely as possible, including all sections and elements (e.g., navigation bar, hero section, buttons, images, and any additional containers).
cover all the elements in the list
MAKE SURE ITS EXACTLY AS IN THE SCREENSHOT
Styling:

Use only black and white styling. No other colors are allowed.
Add clear, descriptive labels for all key sections:
Maintain proper spacing between the elements as in the screenshot. !!!important

The background of the wireframe must be white, and all text and elements should be in black.

Clean and Readable SVG:
The SVG must be properly formatted, with readable indentation for all nested elements.
Validate the SVG to prevent issues:
Escape special characters (<, >, &) in text or attributes.
Ensure proper use of attribute names and values (no invalid whitespace or characters).
For <path> elements, ensure the d attribute contains only valid path commands and coordinates (e.g., M, L, C, Z).

Cover all the elements in the list !! important
every text in the list should be present in the wireframe !! important
Final image should be as close to the original image as possible but black and white !!! important
The size should be scaled to the dimension 1400x800 without any distortion or overlapping of elements
MAKE SURE ITS EXACTLY AS IN THE SCREENSHOT
Return only the SVG code, with no additional text or explanations..

////User Prompt to Html code
            export const htmlGeneratePrompt = `I am providing a Wireframe of a website in the form of SVG code Your task is to generate the following:

1. Responsive HTML Code
Generate clean, semantic HTML code that adheres to the following guidelines:

Structure: Retain the original website layout, including sections like:
Navigation Bar
Hero Section
Buttons (with exact button text and rounded corners)
Headings, paragraphs, and image placeholders.
Text Content: Use the exact text content (headings, button text, and paragraphs) as seen in the screenshot.
Styling:
Use inline CSS for simplicity with Flexbox to ensure responsiveness.
Retain the same colors, fonts, and alignment as in the Svg code.
Represent image placeholders with containers labeled "Image Placeholder."
Buttons should use rounded borders with matching text color and background color.
Responsiveness:
Use Flexbox and media queries to ensure the layout adapts seamlessly across different screen sizes.
Align and space elements proportionally to reflect the original layout.
Ensure text wraps correctly and buttons stack vertically on smaller screens.
2. Key Requirements
Use semantic HTML tags such as <nav>, <header>, <section>, <div>, <h1>, <button>, etc.
Optimize for clarity, scalability, and simplicity.
Ensure the visual output matches the layout, colors, and text of the provided screenshot as closely as possible.
In the Output return just the HTML code and no other text`
